# Joey and John's Racing Adventure

## Description
We plan on making an interactive racing game. It will be set on a track where a player can try to achieve their best lap time. The package will contain animations and sounds for gameplay such as braking, accelerating, turning, and engine idle. The braking and accelerating animations will include laying tire tracks and smoke. We plan to model the smoke using a particle system emitting from the tires and road. We plan to create the turning animations with a blend tree similar to Lab 5. A basic GUI to show speed, direction, lap time, and any extras will be implemented in the package.
